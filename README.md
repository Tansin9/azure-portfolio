My own azure portfolio

## Section 1: Building the frontend
- Created html page to contain Resume info
- implemented javascript code for the visitor counter

## Section 2: Building the backend
- setting up our cosmos DB resources ( creating cosmos DB account, database, and container and data)
- Setting up Azure function (We'll create Azure Function to interact with Cosmos DB counter data)
- test locally (we'll test our function locally and make sure we can view our counter data in the browser and in our website locally)

            <p dir="auto">Quadruped spider robots are sophisticated machines that mimic spider movements and
               behavior by using four adaptable and flexible legs, enabling them to move and stay stable
               even in tight spaces and difficult terrain.</p>

            <p dir="auto">At the moment, mobile robots are gaining popularity. They are classified into three types
               based on how they move :legged robots, wheeled robots, and tracked robots. The main
               advantage of legged robots is that their legs can walk on uneven terrain while remaining
               balanced

            <p dir="auto">Legged robots have several advantages over wheeled robots, especially when traversing
               rough or uneven terrain. While wheeled robots can only travel on flat surfaces, legged
               robots can traverse complex and irregular terrain such as uneven surfaces or stairs.</p>

            <p dir="auto">A microcontroller is a small computer that is used to control the spider robot's
               movements. It sends commands to the robot's actuators to produce the desired movements. The Arduino Uno
               is a popular
               microcontroller board used in electronics projects such as robotics. The board is based on
               the Atmega328P microcontroller and includes a variety of input/output pins for
               connecting to sensors, actuators, and other components. The Arduino Uno's ease of use
               and versatility are two of its main advantages. It has a simple programming language that
               is simple to learn, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users. The
               Arduino Uno serves as the primary controller in this project, governing the robot's
               movement. The servo motors that move the legs are connected to the Arduino board's
               input/output pins, which send signals to the motors to move the legs in the desired
               pattern.

            <p dir="auto">A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of
               angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor
               coupled to a sensor for position feedback. MG-90 servo motors are small, high-quality
               servo motors that are commonly used in a variety of applications, including robotics, RC
               cars, and drones. These motors are popular because of their compact size, high torque

            <p dir="auto">The mechanical structure of a quadruped spider robot is a crucial aspect of its design, as
               it determines the robot's movement capabilities and overall stability. The mechanical
               structure of a quadruped spider robot consists of four legs, each of which is composed of
               several segments connected by joints. These joints are typically actuated by servomotors,
               which allow for precise control over the movement of the legs. The legs are attached to a
               central body, which houses the control electronics, power source, and other components
               of the robot. One of the key design considerations in the mechanical structure of a
               quadruped spider robot is the placement of the legs. The legs are positioned in a way that
               maximizes stability and maneuverability, while minimizing the risk of tipping over or
               losing balance. Additionally, the length and shape of the legs can be adjusted to optimize
               the robot's movement capabilities for specific tasks or environments. Acrylic is a type of
               thermoplastic material that is lightweight, durable, and easy to work with. Similarly,
               Wood is also used to create the framework for the spider robot. These qualities make it an
               ideal choice for constructing the body parts of a quadruped spider robot. Additionally,
               acrylic is easy to cut and shape using a variety of tools, including laser cutters, saws, and
               drills. This makes it easy to create custom body parts that fit the specific needs of the
               robot.

            <p dir="auto">The software design of the quadruped spider robot is a critical component that facilitates
               the control of the robot's movement. The system uses an Arduino
               Uno board executes commands that control the servo
               motors.The software design involves several stages, including programming the Arduino Uno
               board, developing a control algorithm that determines
               the movement of the robot.The software design of the quadruped spider robot requires a deep understanding
               of
               programming and control theory. It involves writing code in various programming
               languages such as C, C++, or Python, depending on the application requirements. The
               software design must also consider the power requirements of the system, as the use of
               multiple servo motors can be power-hungry. With careful planning and implementation,
               it is possible to create a stable and accurate control system that enables the robot to move
